## Features

1. âœ… Replies when pinged.
2. âœ… Replies to last message in channel when your friend (i.e. Derek) starts typing.
3. âœ… Randomly DMs people for added creepiness.
4. âœ… Reacts to messages randomly. Will sometimes react ðŸ¤– to the real Derek.
5. âœ… Will never slur.

## Prerequisites

1. Have a Discord bot. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application. The Message
   Content intent needs to be enabled. It also needs to be able to Read Messages/View Channels and Send Messages, at
   minimum.

2. Get a ChatGPT API key. Create a ChatGPT account and go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` in terminal.
2. Put

```ts
export const chatgptkey = "YOUR_CHATGPT_KEY";
export const discordToken = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN";
export const derekId = "DEREK_DISCORD_ID";
export const botId = "BOT_DISCORD_ID";
```

in `src/Token.ts`.

3. Run `npx tsc` to compile TypeScript.
4. Run `node src/Discord.js`. It should output `Ready!`.
5. To re-run the code after a change, use `npx tsc && node src/Discord.js`.

## Making Your Custom Bot

Most (but not all) of the Derek specific data can be found in `Examples.ts`. Channel whitelists can be found in the `nogoChannels` and `yesChannels` variables in `Discord.ts`.
